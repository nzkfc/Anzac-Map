# NZ/AU ANZAC Ceremony YMAP

Two small YMAP types for you to choose from, both are located at the Observatory in Vinewood. A huge thanks to TayMcKenzieNZ for collaborating to make the advanced version and fixing the flags! Check out his stuff as he makes cool FiveM stuff!: https://forum.cfx.re/u/TayMcKenzieNZ

Basic version:
Simple changes, left mostly open for roleplayers to use in-city business stuff such as food trucks, stages and such as required.

Advanced version:
Everything in basic, except lots of small props added; CCTV poles, signs, food trucks, gazebos, seating, additional bollards, fences, flowers, wreaths, port-o-loos and much more.

1. Download from Github
2. Go into the folder and copy the anzac_map type you want (Basic or Advanced)
3. Put this into your resources folder
4. Add anzac_map_basic or anzac_map_advanced to your server.cfg (Don't use both at the same time!)

If you want to stop cars from driving up the hill on the road, you will need to write up a script to stop traffic: https://forum.cfx.re/t/disable-traffic-in-certain-area/1380615/4
